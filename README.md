# CCWM
A basic window manager written in C. **(Work in progress)**

This project is made solely for the sake of learning more about the Xlib library, the author doesn't expect anyone to use this, but doesn't discourage anyone from doing so either.

# Make
run `make` to compile, and `make install` to install.

Add `exec ccwm` to your .xinitrc
